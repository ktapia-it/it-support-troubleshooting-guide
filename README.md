IT Support Troubleshooting Guide
Overview

This repository contains a structured IT Support Troubleshooting Guide designed to document practical, repeatable approaches to diagnosing and resolving common technical issues encountered in entry-level and junior IT support environments.

The guide reflects a methodical troubleshooting mindset aligned with CompTIA A+ best practices, focusing on clear diagnostics, logical escalation, and documentation to prevent recurring issues.

Purpose

The goal of this guide is to demonstrate:

A consistent, step-by-step troubleshooting methodology

Clear technical documentation suitable for help desk and IT support roles

Practical experience resolving common hardware, software, and connectivity issues

The ability to communicate technical processes in a clear, usable format

This documentation is intended to mirror the type of internal knowledge base or runbook commonly used in IT support teams.

Troubleshooting Methodology

Each scenario in the guide follows a structured approach:

Issue Identification

Understand and clarify the reported problem

Identify symptoms, scope, and affected systems

Initial Diagnostics

Check common failure points

Verify configurations, connections, and system status

Root Cause Analysis

Isolate the underlying cause through logical testing

Eliminate unrelated variables

Resolution Steps

Apply corrective actions

Verify system stability and functionality

Documentation & Prevention

Record the issue and resolution

Identify steps to prevent recurrence
